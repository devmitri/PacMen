# PacMen
## A simple game that spawns multiple PacMen that move across the browser window at random.

How to Run: Click on the "Start Game" button. Then click on the "Add Pacman" button as much as you'd like to spawn Pacmen. *It is necessary to click "Start Game" first to avoid spawning a pacman over the start button.*

Roadmap: I want to add animations and reverse orientation of the pacman image depending on the direction the pacmen are going.
